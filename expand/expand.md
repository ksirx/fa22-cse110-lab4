1. Some JavaScript developers believe that most of the issues with JavaScript stem from its asynchronous nature, its loose typing, and the web platform it runs on. For each of the three reasons listed, explain in your own words why a developer might believe that it is a pain point.

Developers may have an issue with its asynchronus nature because this is somthing that is different from many other languages. The fact that it is different makes it more difficult to learn and confusing to understand what is going in in the code. Issues with the loose typing can because there isn't much consistency with what it outputs. This can make debugging and learning the langauge difficult because things may not behave the way you expect it to. The platform it runs on can cause issues because it seems to run individually on Nodejs which is also different from other platforms. This makes the way that it is utilized different from most other programming langauges.

2. Related to the first question, why do you believe that the developer(s) who created JavaScript made it loosely typed? Why do you think they added asynchronous features?
What are the key differences between a compiled language and an interpreted one? Which one is JavaScript? What are the benefits & drawbacks of JavaScript being made that way?

I believe that the developers that created Javascript made it loosely typed because it makes creating some interactions easier. I think the asynchronus feature is there because it is particularly useful for creating websites. This is just soemthing that makes reading events possible compared to if it was synchronus . The different between compiled language and interpreted is that there is less abstraction for compiled, but it is more verbose to get the same thing done in a interpreted language. Javascript is definitly a interpreted langauge. This allows for ease of use to make complex things on activation of a function, but it will run really slow and heavy.

3. The professor believes that, though sometimes misused, JavaScript frameworks are incredibly powerful tools that can help teams work more efficiently and effectively. Given that, why do you believe he is focusing more on vanilla JavaScript for this course? What are the benefits of mastering vanilla JS first? What are the drawbacks of not learning a framework?

He is focusing on more vanilla JS because he wants to prevent us learning abstraction too early. The benefit of learning it first is that we understand what goes on behind the abstraction and the things we learn will never no be relevent. The main draw back of not learning a framework is that it may take longer to get the same things done than if we were using a framework.

4. Explain, in your own words, how you think this lab relates to your project. How might you be able to use this information in your own project?

I think this lab relates to the project because we will need to utilize the vanilla javascript in order to create the proper functionality for the project. I can use this information to understand what I need to get better on to be a strong contributer in a group setting.
